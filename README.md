# Learning TypeScript

#### TypeScript is scalable JavaScript

## Prehistory

<p> When I have learned JavaScript at a good level, I decided move forward.
JavaScript is awesome, and it has some bits and bobs. But even I face with different problems.
Dynamic typing boost you in language learning, but it slows down general developing yourself.</p>
<p>My study continued with React JS. In the summer of 2021 I had been developing SPA for my
campus(<em>The project is abandoned, as the leader left us</em>). It showed me a lot of problems
related to typing, lack of interfaces, unexpected result, etc. And I determined to it's time to 
do something about it. Definitely, TypeScript won't resolve all, and JavaScript is perhaps the best thing
we have. But companies demand TypeScript and I want to try something new, so why not?</p>

## This is where my typescript learning begins

<p>I'm learning TypeScript with the book "Professional TypeScript" by Boris Chernyy published by O'Reilly.
I'll do exercises and push here to <u><b>other branches</b></u>. But it's not all. I'll push here some other tasks or something
interesting tied to TypeScript as well.</p>

<p>If you're interested about this whole, you'll be able to switch branch and look at all. 
Also, If you want to partner with me, you'll be able to contact me. Contact details are fixed on the
